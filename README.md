# Blowfish Algorithm

### Known errors:

- Some values might generate an IndexError, while other values cannot fit 'int' into an index-sized integer. 
- This issue occurs because of the conversions between string, bytes, and integers.
- It will be fixed in the near future, but small strings will still be encrypted and decrypted.
